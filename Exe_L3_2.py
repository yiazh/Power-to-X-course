#1. Calculate the yearly hydrogen production using fixed efficiency model

#2. Assume that the project life is 15 years, calculate the cash flow of every year. Express the result in a list with length of 16.
# (Assume the hydrogen price is 2â‚¬/kg and the yearly wind power remains the same)

#3. Based on the cash flow you got from (2), calculate the NPV. (discount rate is 0.05)

#4. Calculate the LCOH (discount rate is 0.05), using the two definitions and compare the results.
